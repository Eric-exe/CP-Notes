Intuition: Integer solutions

Bezout's identity: Suppose $a$ and $b$ are integers. Then the diophantine equation $ax+by=\gcd(a, b)$ has a solution.

In other words, given:
$ax + by + cz + ... = e$, if $\gcd(a,b, c,...)$ divides $e$, then there is a integer solution. Integer solution can be found via Euclidean algorithm.
