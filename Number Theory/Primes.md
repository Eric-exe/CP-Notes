### Prime Number Theorem
The number of primes up to $x$ is roughly $\frac{x}{ln(x)}$. In other words, of the first $n$ integers, approximately $\frac{1}{ln(n)}$ of them are prime.

### Bertrand's Postulate 
For each positive integer $x$, there exists at least 1 prime $p$ inside the interval $[x, 2x]$.
